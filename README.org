#+html: <p align="center"><img src="https://melpa.org/packages/ivy-pass-badge.svg" /></p>
** Quick start

Install,    configure    and     initialize    =pass=    according    to
https://www.passwordstore.org/.  For =pass otp=  you'll need [[https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp/][otp.bash]] in
=.extensions= directory.

To  use  =ivy= as  =pass=  frontend,  clone  project into  =source-dir=  and
configure =init.el=

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package ivy-pass
  :ensure password-store-otp
  :load-path "source-dir")
#+end_src

evaluate, and  run =M-x  ivy-pass=. The  default action  is to  copy the
password to the kill ring.

** Other actions (accessible with =M-o=):
- edit an entry (=e=)
- delete an entry (=d=)
- add an entry (=a=)
- rename an entry (=r=)
- generate a new entry (=g=)
- copy otp token (=t=)
